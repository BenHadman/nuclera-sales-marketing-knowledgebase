# Customer Objections

**Handling Glycosylation Objections in Cell-Free Protein Synthesis**

**Audience:** Nuclera Field Staff  
**Use Case:** Responding to customer concerns about lack of glycosylation in Nuclera’s eProtein Discovery system.

---

### **Key Message**

Nuclera’s eProtein Discovery system does **not** glycosylate proteins — but in most use cases, that’s not a blocker.

---

### **How to Respond**

1. **Be upfront: our system does not glycosylate proteins.**  
   Cell-free protein synthesis reagents, including eukaryotic ones, do not fully reconstitute ER or Golgi functions. So if a protein absolutely requires glycosylation, cell-free may not be suitable.

2. **Put it in context.**  
   Most membrane and secreted proteins are glycosylated, but few depend on glycosylation for folding or function. Proteins almost never require glycosylation at a specific site. When proteins are glycosylated in multiple places, the effect is usually **additive** — explaining why proteins with many glycans may benefit more from glycosylation for stability.

* For example, each glycan adds **\~0.5–0.9 °C** to the melting temperature. It would take **at least 5 glycosites** to raise the melting temperature by more than 5 °C.

  * Proteins with **\>3 N-glycosylation sites** represent only **\~13%** of N-linked glycoproteins

  * Glycans improve stability **incrementally**

3. **Use strong functional data.**  
   \> 70-80% of secreted/membrane proteins are N-glycosylated. Almost no intracellular protein is N-glycosylated. Approximately **87%** of those proteins that are N-glycosylated are glycosylated in a way that likely does **not** affect protein folding or activity (i.e., inverse of \~13% stat above). 

* Supporting study: Only **\~14%** of glycoproteins had glycans critical to preventing aggregation under physiological conditions.

4. **Drive it home with a soundbite.**  
   \> “**Don’t let the tail of glycosylation wag the dog.**”  
   Unless glycosylation is known to be essential, it probably isn’t.

5. **Mention alternatives.**  
   Other post-translational modifications (e.g., **phosphorylation**) are supported via additives or co-expression with modifying enzymes (e.g., **kinases from NEB or Thermo**).
