**AlphaFold Overview**

Protein folding, solubility, and functional stability remain key bottlenecks in protein engineering, structural biology, and target discovery. Traditional methods are slow, iterative, and often result in low-yield or misfolded proteins.

AlphaFold integration into eProtein Discovery™ transforms protein design into a smart, structure-guided workflow. Instantly visualize predicted 3D structures, identify critical regions for truncation or mutation, and screen variants for soluble expression — all in one automated system. Move from prediction to folded, active protein in just 48 hours.

With AlphaFold-guided variant design and eProtein Discovery’s automated screening, protein engineering is no longer guesswork — it’s a data-driven strategy that accelerates discovery.
