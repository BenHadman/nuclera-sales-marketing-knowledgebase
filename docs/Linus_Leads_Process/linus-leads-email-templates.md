Hi {{Lead.fname}},

It is great to hear that {{Lead.company_name}} might be interested in what Nuclera has to offer.

Our eProtein bioprinter allows scientists to make progress on protein projects through a rapid protein prototyping system. It automates construct screening, expression, characterization, and purification of proteins produced on smart cartridges.

If you would like to hear more about this we can organize a short 20 minute 1:1 call to learn a little bit about what you do as well as give you a taste of how our solution may be able to help. 

If there appears to be a good fit we can then arrange a more detailed dive into the technology for you and your colleagues. 

I have suggested a few times below, if any of them work for you then please select it and I will look forward to speaking with you then. If these times are not convenient then let me know and I will happily try to arrange a call for another time.
