# Asset Register

This document holds the finalised, ready for public consumption sales and marketing assets.
The Asset Register will maintain the latest version of the all of the documents and prevent us from showing out of date and potentially misleading information to our prospects and customers.

### Fixed Assets
These assets are changed infrequently by a smaller group of people and are controlled by a version control system.
The only links that are available are un-editable, public facing links and hosted in the correct environment.
See the column *Public URL* for the right link.

E.g. Application notes, videos, flyers and publications.

### Customisable Assets
Customisable assets are a group of assets that are frequently personalised for specific customers or adapted for a particular event.
Please try to build new customised Sales Decks from these Master sources and not create branches from previous versions.
If you have build some new content into a branched version that you would like to see in the Master or a variation of the Master then let marketing know and we can incorporate changes or generate a new variation. This will help us all in the long run as all improvements will merge back into a single Master file.

To copy from the Master and create a branch (e.g. for a personalised Sales deck) see the column *Create Branch*
To edit the original Master file see the column *Edit Original*
