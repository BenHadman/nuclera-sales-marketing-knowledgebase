## Lead Conversion

Leads within Salesforce are the earliest stage of recording information about a person and the company they work for.
Leads need to taken through the Lead Conversion Process within a reasonable timeframe (5 days).
This involves adding and enriching basic data on the Lead and then marking records as Status - 'Closed - Converted' and converting them to a Contact and an Account and/or associated with an existing Contact or Account.
If there is no fit either now or in the future then Leads should be marked 'Closed - Not Converted'. [See more info](https://knowledgebase.nuclera.com/docs/Salesforce/leads#converting-a-lead)

This lead conversion event is crucial to to be completed:

- Indicates that measures have been taken to make contact and create an Opportunity (through a Qualification Call).
- Curates the contact database so that we form a indexed and linked network of all contacts and accounts in our Total Addressible Market that can be marketed to.
