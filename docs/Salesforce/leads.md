# Leads

## Converting a Lead

When you convert a lead, Salesforce creates an account, contact, and optionally an opportunity, using information from the lead you're converting. The converted lead becomes a read-only record.

If existing accounts and contacts share the names specified on the leads, you can choose to associate with existing accounts and contacts.
