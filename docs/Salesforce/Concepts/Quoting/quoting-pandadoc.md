### Customer Inputs

The Red/Orange Inputs are required from the customer to be able to process the Quote & Purchase Order and move the Order into Fulfilment.

Each colour denotes a different role. Billing Contact and Shipping Contact, this allows you to designate two separate people to fill in this data if the responsibilities are split at the customer's company, alternatively they can be assigned to the same person.

These fields are e-sign fields which the customer fills in.

Some of the data is pre-filled if the Salesforce Contact & Account record already has this on file.
