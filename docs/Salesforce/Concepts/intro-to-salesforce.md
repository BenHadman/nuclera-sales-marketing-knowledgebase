# Intro to Salesforce

Salesforce is the Nuclera Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform of choice.

The tool captures all 'touchpoints' with our prospects, contacts and customers. All email communication, call notes and meetings are recorded against a record in the system so that all relevant Nuclera staff can see an accurate picture of the business relationship we have with them.
