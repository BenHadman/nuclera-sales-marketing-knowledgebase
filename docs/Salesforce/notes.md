# Recording (Long Form) Notes

Long form notes describing for example a customer visit can be recorded in Salesforce and associated with multiple records of any type like Account, Contact and Opportunity.
*Best Practice:* It is recommended that customer call notes are associated with the Account, all Contacts present and the Opportunity (if one exists)
