# Opportunities

We us an opportunity process to guide each sales opportunity down a specific route. We do this to ensure best practice is followed in the qualification and nothing is missed off.

It is very important that opportunities are well qualified we spend time on the ones most likely to convert to a sale. The use of a specific process with clear criteria ensures that our attention is turned to the high probability opportunities and not to the people that demand the most attention, as human nature to opts toward.

The use of a defined process has another useful outcome, when used across a cohort of multiple opportunities which have all been through the same process we can start to apply probabilities -of closing the deal- to each stage as well as spotting trends between different types of account.
