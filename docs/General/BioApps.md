The BioApps Bitesize template should be pre-loaded, if it isn't then copy the [template code](#Slack-Setup-Code) from below and paste into the 'Payload' code editor.
4. Strip down the template to be the same number of blocks as the number of experiments you want to feature in the newsletter. You can do this by hovering over the section in the Slack Block Kit Builder and clicking the rubbish bin icon.
5. Now you have the right structure/ number of blocks it is just the case of replacing the template content with real content. To do this it if probably best to just use find and replace (ctrl + f). To do this, scan the preview of the message for the templated content, using the find tool search for where that corresponds to in the JSON code in the right hand side 'Payload' panel and replace the content.
6. To note down each specific edit for the experiment blocks see below:

| Experiment Field             | Description | Template text (for the first entry) |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Experiment Title             | TextField   | {Experiment Title 1} |
| Experiment PDF link          | URL         | https://experimentlink1.com (needs replacing in two places per experiment) |
| Experiment ID                | TextField   | {Experiment ID1} |
| Who/ Person Responsible      | @person     | {SlackUser1} ([See here](#Tagging-Slack-Users) for @ tagging Slack users) |
| Team                         | TextField   | {Team1} |
| Text description (Optional)  | TextField   | {test description 1} |
| Conclusion                   | TextField   | {conclusion 1} |
| Tags                         | List        | {Tags_delete_where_appropriate1} (Delete the tags tat aren't appropriate) |
| Image Thumbnail              | Image       | {https://imageurl1.com} |

### Tagging Slack Users

To do an @ tag of a user so their slack profile is linked and they get notified of the meessage by a 'ping' you have to find their Slack ID.
Alternatively just write their name in plain text.
To find a Slack username see [this link](https://www.workast.com/help/article/how-to-find-a-slack-user-id/)

### Notes & Gotchas

- You can format text using markdown language, to see the formatting options that are available in Slack see [here](https://api.slack.com/reference/surfaces/formatting)
